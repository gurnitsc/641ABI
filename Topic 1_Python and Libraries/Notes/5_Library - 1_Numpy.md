## 1. Introduction
**Install Numpy**

- Windows
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```
- Macbook
    ```bash
    pip3 install numpy
    ```
**What is NumPy?**
- NumPy stands for *Numerical Python*.
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

**Why Use NumPy?**
- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
- *NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.*
- The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.
- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

## 2. Create a basic array
- Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the `import` keyword:
	```python
    import numpy as np
	```
- To create a NumPy array, you can use the function `np.array()` and pass a list to it.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.array([1, 2, 3])
    array([1, 2, 3])
    ```
- We can create an array filled with 0's and 1's:
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.zeros(2)
    array([0., 0.])
    >>> np.ones(2)
    array([1., 1.])
    ```
- Sometimes, we need an empty array, which we need to fill some numbers later. The initial content in the empty array is *random* and depends on the state of our computer memory.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.empty(2)
    array([2.05833592e-312, 2.33419537e-312])
    ```
- We can create an array with a range of elements:
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.arange(4)
    array([0, 1, 2, 3])
    ```
- Or even an array that contains of certain (e.g., evenly spaced) intervals.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.arange(2, 9, 2)
    array([2, 4, 6, 8])
    >>> np.arange(2, 9, 3)
    array([2, 5, 8])
    ```
- We can also to create an array with values that are spaced linearly in a specified interval by using `np.linspace()` . Note that the boundaries would be included in the output, and the length of the output equals the parameter `num`.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.linspace(0, 10, num=6)
    array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8., 10.])
    ```

## 3. Indexing and slicing
- Indices in NumPy arrays are quite similar to those in lists.
- Aslo, `len` function still works here.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> len(data)
    4
    >>> data[0]
    1
    >>> data[1:]
    array([2, 3, 4])
    >>> data[:2]
    array([1, 2])
    ```
**'Negative' index**
- We can use negative index to access the element by counting inversely from the end. It also works in lists.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> data[-1]
    4
    >>> data[-2]
    3
    >>> data[:-2]
    array([1, 2])
    >>> data[-2:]
    array([3, 4])
    ```

## 4. Operations - 1: Basic
- With NumPy, we can perform easily addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more for a list of values.
- For example, if we would like to perform operations on the corresponding elements in two list, we need to use loop. 
    ```python
    data_1 = [1, 2, 3]
    data_2 = [11, 21, 31]

    l = []
    for i in range(len(data_1)):
        l.append(data_1[i] + data_2[i])

    print(l)
    ```
- However, with NumPy we can easily finish it.
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    data_1 = [1, 2, 3]
    data_2 = [11, 21, 31]

    data_1, data_2 = np.array(data_1), np.array(data_2)

    print(data_1 + data_2)
    print(data_1 - data_2)
    print(data_1 * data_2)
    ```
## 5. Operations - 2: Broadcasting
- There are times when you might want to carry out an operation between an array and a single number.
- For example, our array (we’ll call it “data”) might contain information about distance in miles, but you want to convert the information to kilometers. You can perform this operation with:
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> data * 1.6
    array([1.6, 3.2, 4.8])
    ```
## 6. Conditionals used in NumPy
- With broadcasting, we can obtain an array with boolean values. For example, we have a data, and would like to use which values are larger than a particular value.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23])
    >>> data > 10
    array([ True, False, False, False,  True,  True,  True])
    >>> data[data>10]
    array([23, 54, 89, 23])
    ```
- In the above program, `data>10` gives us the boolean values indicating whether an element in the array is larger than 10. Then, in `data[data>10]`, with the bracket operator we can obtain the values in `data` that satisfy the condition `>10`. It is so convenient and efficient by avoiding loops.
- It can be applied to select certain values that fulfill any condition. For example, we discussed how to obtain even/odd number before.
    ```python
    >>> data = [23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23]
    >>> odd_number = [i for i in data if i%2 != 0]
    >>> odd_number
    [23, 9, 89, 23]
    ```
- With Numpy, it is much easier to obtain the results.
    ```python
    >>> data = [23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23]
    >>> data = np.array(l)
    >>> odd_number = data[data%2!=0]
    >>> odd_number
    array([23,  9, 89, 23])
    ```

## 7. Statistical calculations
- NumPy also performs aggregation functions. In addition to `min`, `max`, and `sum`, you can easily run `mean` to get the average, `prod` to get the result of multiplying the elements together, `std` to get the standard deviation, and more.
- For example, we can use the following methods to obtain the statistics, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, `std`.
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23])
    >>> data.sum()
    208
    >>> data.min()
    2
    >>> data.max()
    89
    >>> data.mean()
    29.714285714285715
    >>> data.std()
    28.941884062051393
    ```
- We can use the following functions in NumPy to obtain quartiles (Q1-25th percentile, Q2 - 50th percentile (median), Q3 - 75th percentile)
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23])
    >>> np.percentile(data, 25)
    8.5
    >>> np.percentile(data, 50)
    23.0
    >>> np.percentile(data, 75)
    38.5
    ```
