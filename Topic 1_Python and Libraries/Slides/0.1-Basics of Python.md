## 1. Vairables and functions


**String formatting**

```python
name = 'Jin'
print('Hello, ' + name)
```

```python
n = 35
n_as_str = str(n)
print("The number of students is " + n_as_str)
```

---
**f-string**
```python
x = 3
y = 4

z = x + y

print(f"{x} plus {y} equals {z}.")
```
---

**Create our own function by `def`**

---

**First function without arguments**

```python
def hello():
	print("Hello, ")
```

---
**Function with arguments**

```python
def hello(nm):
	print("Hello, ", end="")
	print(nm)
```

---

**Function with default value**

```python
# create hello() function
def hello(nm, greeting="Hello "):
	print(greeting, end="")
	print(nm)

name_1 = "Jin"
name_2 = "Mark"

# say "Hello" to Jin
hello(name_1)

# say "Hello" to Mark
hello(name_2)
```
---

**Return values**

```python
def add(a, b):
	c = a + b
	return c
```
---

## 2. Conditionals and loops

---
### 2.1 Conditionals
---

**Relational operators**
- Python has a set of "**Operators**" that can be used to ask mathematical questions.

| Symbol  | meaning                  |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| > and < | larger and smaller       |
| >=      | greater than or equal to |
| <=      | less than or equal to    |
| ==      | equals                   |
| !=      | not equal to             |


---
**Logical operators**

- **`and` operator**
- **`or` operator**

---

**Conditional statement: : `if` statement**

```python
x = float(input("Please input a number: "))

if x>0:
    print("It is a positive number.")
```

---

**Alternative execution: Control Flow, `else`, and `elif`**

```python
D = float(input("Please input a number: "))

if x>0:
    print("It is a positive number.")
elif x==0:
    print("It is zero.")
else:
    print("It is a negative number.")
```
---

**Pythonic `if`**
- 'Pythonic' code means the code only seen in Python programming.
  
	```python
	x = int(input("Please input an integer: "))

	b = True if x!=0 else False

	if b:
		print("x is not zero.")
	else:
		print("x is zero")	
	```

---

### 2.1 Loops
---

**`while` loops**

```python
i = 3
while i>0:
    print("Hello")
    i-=1
```
- decrement, `i-=1`
- increment, `i+=1`
---

**`for` loops**

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello")
```
---

**`continue` and `break`**

`break`

```python
while True:
    n = int(input("Please input a score (0-100): "))
    if 0<=n<=100:
        break

print(n)
```
---

**continue**
- Different from `break`, *`continue` tells Python to go to the next iteration for a loop and ignore the code after `continue`*. For example,
	```python
	for i in range(4):
		if i == 1:
			continue

		print(i)
	```

---
## 3. Strings and lists

---

### 3.1 Strings

```python
>>> s = "Hello"
>>> letter = s[1]
>>> letter
```
**Strings are immutable**


**`len` function**

---
**String slices**

```python
>>> s = "Hello, Jin!"
>>> s[2:5]
'llo'
>>> s[:2]
'He'
>>> s[-1]
'!'
>>> s[-2:]
'n!'
```

---
**(Fruitful) String Methods**

- `.strip()`
- `.title()`
- `.upper()`
- `.split()`
---
### 3.2 list

---

**A list is a sequence**

```python
>>> list_1 = [10, 20, 30, 40]
>>> list_2 = ['Rutgers', 'Princeton', 'NYU']
```

**`len()` function**

**List slices**


**Lists are mutable**

---
**(Void) List methods**
- `.append()`
- `.sort()`

---
**List operations**

- `+` operator
- `*` operator
- `in` operator

---

`Map`

```python
def square(x)
    return number ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared = map(square, numbers)

print(list(squared))
```
---

`lambda() function`

```python
def divide(x, y):
    return x/y

# lambda function, which is equivalent to the above divide function.
divide = lambda x, y: x/y

print(divide(1,3))
```
- - Which is interesting in lambda functions is that *if we don't assign lambda function to a variable, Python will destroy it immediately.*

---
**Lamdba function in `map()`**
- Lambda function is often used in when a function is used only once. 
- For example, in the above map program, we can use lambda function instead of defining an explicit function.
    ```python
	numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	squared = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)

	print(list(squared))
    ```
---
`Filter`

```python
numbers = [0, -1, 2, -3, 4]
positive_values = filter(lambda n: n>0, numbers)

print(list(positive_values))
```

---

**Loop alternative: List comprehension**

```python
numbers = [1, 3, 5]

double_numbers = [n * 2 for n in numbers]

print(double_numbers)
```

**Comprehensions with conditionals**

```python
numbers = [1, -2, 3, -4]
positive_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n > 0] 
print(positive_numbers)
```
---

## 4. Set, tuple, and dictionary

---
### 4.1 Set

**Defining sets**
- Sets don't hold order
- Sets don't allow duplicate elements

```python
>>> universities = {'Rutgers', 'NYU', 'Princeton'}
>>> universities
{'Rutgers', 'Princeton', 'NYU'}
```

---
**list-like function and opertion**
- `len()` function
- `in` operation

---
**List and set are interchangeable**

```python
>>> l = [2, 0, 2, 3]
>>> s = set(l)
>>> s
{0, 2, 3}
>>> l_new = list(s)
[0, 2, 3]
```

---

**(Fruitful) Set Methods and Operations**
- `intersection()` method and `&` operator
- `union()` method and `|` operator
- `difference()` method and `-` operator

---

### 4.2 Tuple
---
**Defining tuples**

```python
>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' # or t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
>>> t
('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```

**list-like Slice operator**

```python
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
>>> t[0]
'a'
>>> t[1:3]
('b', 'c')
```

**Tuples are immutable**

---

**Tuple assignment**
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
```

**Tuples as return values**

```python
def get_quot_rem(x, y):
    return x//y, x%y

x, y = 7, 3
quot, rem = get_quot_rem(x, y)
```
---

**`zip()` function**
```python
counties = ['MIDDLESEX', 'MIDDLESEX', 'SOMERSET']
cities = ['Piscataway', 'HIGHLAND PARK', 'FLAGTOWN']
zipcodes = ['08854', '08904', '08821']

print(zip(counties, cities, zipcodes))

```

---
**`enumerate()` function**

```python
universities = ["Princeton", "MIT", "Harvard", "Stanford"]

for i, university in enumerate(universities):
    print(i+1, university)
```
---

### 4.3 Dictionary

- We can *define a dictionary* in the following way.
	```python
	>>> eng2arabic = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
	```

- We can *add new items*
	```python
	>>> eng2arabic = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
	>>> eng2arabic['four'] = 4
	>>> eng2arabic
	{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
	```
- Define an empty dictionary, then add items.
	```python
	>>> d = dict() # d would be an empty dictionary
	>>> d['one'] = 1
	>>> d['two'] = 2
	>>> d
	{'one': 1, 'two': 2}
	```
---
**loopup**    
- `len` function
- Lookup
- `in` operator (for keys, not values)
---

**Dictionary and list**

```python
cities = ['PISCATAWAY', 'HIGHLAND PARK', 'FLAGTOWN']
zipcodes = ['08854', '08904', '08821']

d = dict(zip(cities, zipcodes))
print(d)

print(d['PISCATAWAY'])
```
