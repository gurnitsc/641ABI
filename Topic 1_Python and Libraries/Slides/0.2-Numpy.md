## 1. Introduction
---


**Install Numpy**
Windows
	```bash
	pip install numpy
	```
Macbook
	```bash
	pip3 install numpy
	```

---
**What is NumPy?**
- NumPy stands for *Numerical Python*.
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

---

**Why Use NumPy?**
- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
- *NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.*
- The array object in NumPy is called `ndarray`, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with `ndarray` very easy.
- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

## 2. Create a basic array

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.array([1, 2, 3])
array([1, 2, 3])
```
---

create an array filled with 0's and 1's:

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.zeros(2)
array([0., 0.])
>>> np.ones(2)
array([1., 1.])
```
---

`np.arange()`

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.arange(4)
array([0, 1, 2, 3])
```
---
`np.linspace()`--- create an array with values that are spaced linearly in a specified interval by using `np.linspace()` . Note that the boundaries would be included in the output, and the length of the output equals the parameter `num`.
```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.linspace(0, 10, num=6)
array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8., 10.])
```

---
## 3. list-like Indexing and slicing


---

## 4. Operations - 1: Basic

**element-wise calculation**
```python
import numpy as np
data_1 = [1, 2, 3]
data_2 = [11, 21, 31]

data_1, data_2 = np.array(data_1), np.array(data_2)

print(data_1 + data_2)
print(data_1 - data_2)
print(data_1 * data_2)
```
---

## 5. Operations - 2: Broadcasting

```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> data = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> data * 1.6
    array([1.6, 3.2, 4.8])
```

---
## 6. Conditionals used in NumPy

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = np.array([23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23])
>>> data > 10
array([ True, False, False, False,  True,  True,  True])
>>> data[data>10]
array([23, 54, 89, 23])
```
---
- example: to find odd numbers from a list.
	```python
	>>> data = [23, 2, 9, 8, 54, 89, 23]
	>>> data = np.array(l)
	>>> odd_number = data[data%2!=0]
	>>> odd_number
	array([23,  9, 89, 23])
	```


---

## 7. Statistical calculations

- min
- max
- sum
- standard deviation - `std`
- percentiles ($Q_1$, $Q_2$ (median), $Q_3$,) - `np.percentile(data, perc)`
