## 1. Introduction

**What is Pandas?**
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
- It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

**Why use pandas?**
- Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
- Relevant data is very important in data science.

**Installation of Pandas**
- Windows
    ```base
    pip install pandas
    ```
- Macbook
    ```base
    pip3 install pandas
    ```

**Usage**
- Like NumPy, we need to import pandas library
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    ```





## 2. Basic data structures - Series
### Series
- `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). 
- The axis labels are collectively referred to as the **index**. The basic method to create a `Series` is to callï¼š
	`s = pd.Series(data, index=index)`, 
	- where `data` can be many different things:
		- a Python dict
		- a NumPy ndarray
		- a scalar value.
	- The passed `index` is a list of axis labels. 

### From ndarray
- If `data` is an ndarray, **index** must be the same length as **data**. If no index is passed, one will be created having values `[0, ..., len(data) - 1]`.
- For example,
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> s = pd.Series(np.array([10,11,12]))
    >>> s
    0    10
    1    11
    2    12
    dtype: int64
    ```
- In the above code, we didn't set index, thus the indices are default. Next, let us set index
    ```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> s = pd.Series(np.array([10,11,12]), index = ['a', 'b', 'c'])
    >>> s
    a    10
    b    11
    c    12
    dtype: int64
    ```

### From dictionary
- Instantiate Series from a dictionary. The index would be the keys if no index is passed.
    ```python
    >>> d = {'Jack': 90, 'Ben': 88, 'Mary': 30 }
    >>> pd.Series(d)
    Jack    90
    Ben     88
    Mary    30
    dtype: int64
    ```
- If an index is passed, the values in data corresponding to the labels in the index will be pulled out.

### Series is ndarray-like
- `Series` acts very similarly to a `ndarray`. For example, it can support vectorized operations (element-wise operations).
    ```python
    >>> s1 = pd.Series(np.array([10,11,12]))
    >>> s2 = pd.Series(np.array([2,3,4]))
    >>> s1 + s2
    0    12
    1    14
    2    16
    dtype: int64
    >>> s1 * s2
    0    20
    1    33
    2    48
    dtype: int64
    ```
- `Series` is a valid argument to most NumPy functions. 
    ```python
    >>> s1 = pd.Series(np.array([10,11,12]))
    >>> np.sum(s1)
    33
    >>> np.log(s1)
    0    2.302585
    1    2.397895
    2    2.484907
    dtype: float64
    ```
- Slicing in Series is also like NumPy
    ```python
    >>> s = pd.Series(np.array([9,10,11,12, 13]))
    >>> s[0]
    9
    >>> s[:3]
    0     9
    1    10
    2    11
    dtype: int64
    >>> s[-2:]
    3    12
    4    13
    dtype: int64
    ```
- However, `Series` usually uses `.iloc[]` operations to get the value(s). 
    ```python
    >>> s = pd.Series(np.array([9,10,11,12, 13]))
    >>> s.iloc[0]
    9
    >>> s.iloc[:3]
    0     9
    1    10
    2    11
    dtype: int64
    >>> s.iloc[-2:]
    3    12
    4    13
    dtype: int64
    ```

### Series is dict-like
- A `Series` is also like a fixed-size dict in that you can get and set values by index label:
    ```python
    >>> s = pd.Series(np.array([9,10,11,12]), index = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
    >>> s['a']
    9
    ```

## 3. Basic data structures - DataFrame

### DataFrame
- `DataFrame` is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. 
- You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. 
- It is generally the most commonly used pandas object. Like Series, DataFrame accepts many different kinds of input:
	- Dict of 1D ndarrays, lists, dicts, or `Series`
	- 2-D numpy.ndarray
	- A `Series`
	- Another `DataFrame`
### From series
- The resulting **index** will be the **union** of the indexes of the various Series.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    d = {
        "one": pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], index=["a", "b", "c"]),
        "two": pd.Series([21.0, 22.0, 23.0, 4.0], index=["b", "a", "c", "d"]),
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(d)

    print(df)
    ```
- The output is 
    ```python
    one   two
    a  1.0  22.0
    b  2.0  21.0
    c  3.0  23.0
    d  NaN   4.0
    ```

### From dictionary
- We can easily get a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary.
- 
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    Dict = {
            'name': ['Jack', 'Mary', 'Joan'],
            'grade': [90, 85, 77],
            'Section': ['Section 7', 'Section 15', 'Section 7']
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(Dict)
    print(df)
    ```
- Output
    ```python
    name  grade     Section
    0  Jack     90   Section 7
    1  Mary     85  Section 15
    2  Joan     77   Section 7
    ```
- Since no index was passes, the default indices are 0, 1, 2.
- We can pass index.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    Dict = {
        'grade': [90, 85, 77],
        'Section': ['Section 7', 'Section 15', 'Section 7'],
        "HW": [91, 92, 93]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(Dict, index= ['Jack', 'Mary', 'Joan'])
    print(df)
    ```
- The output would be
    ```python
        grade     Section  HW
    Jack     90   Section 7  91
    Mary     85  Section 15  92
    Joan     77   Section 7  93
    ```

## 4. Obtain characteristics of dataFrame

Based on the dataFrame `df` defined above, we can obtain the characteristics.

**Shape**
- `df.shape` return the shape of the dataFrame, i.e., the number of rows and the number of columns.
    ```python
    >>> df.shape
    (3, 3)
    ```
**Column name**
- to obtain column names
    ```python
    >>> df.column
    Index(['grade', 'Section', 'HW'], dtype='object')
    ```

**index**
- obtain index
    ```python
    >>> df.index
    Index(['Jack', 'Mary', 'Joan'], dtype='object')
    ```

## 5. Column selection, addition, deletion
- Based on the dataFrame `df` defined above, let us select the column(s) we are interested.

**Choose a single column**
- Using *column name* to obtain a column. 
    ```python
    >>> c = df['grade']
    >>> c
    Jack    90
    Mary    85
    Joan    77
    Name: grade, dtype: int64
    >>> type(c)
    <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
    ```
- The type is `Series`, rather than dataFrame.
- We can also use `.loc[,]` method to obtain a single column. In the method, the number before comma indicates row number; the number after comma indicates column number. They all start with 0. `:` means all rows or columns.
    ```python
    >>> df.iloc[:,0]
    Jack    90
    Mary    85
    Joan    77
    Name: grade, dtype: int64
    ```


**Choose multiple columns**
- We can use a list of columns to obtain multiple columns.
    ```python
    >>> df1 = df[['grade', 'HW']]
    >>> df1
        grade  HW
    Jack     90  91
    Mary     85  92
    Joan     77  93
    >>> type(df1)
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    ```
- Take care here. The type of `df1` is DataFrame, rather than `Series`.
- We can also use `.loc[,]` method to obtain the same result.
    ```python
    >>> df2 = df.iloc[:,[0,2]]
        grade  HW
    Jack     90  91
    Mary     85  92
    Joan     77  93
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
    ```
- In the above program, the value after comma is a list of numbers, which are the column indices.
    ```python
    >>> df2 = df.iloc[:,:2]
        grade     Section
    Jack     90   Section 7
    Mary     85  Section 15
    Joan     77   Section 7
    ```

## 6. Write and read a csv file

**Write a csv file**
- Sometimes, we need to save our dataFrame. It is good to save it as a csv file by `df.to_csv('filename')`.  For example,
    ```ptyhon
    df.to_csv('grade.csv')
    ```

**Read a csv file**
- We can use `pd.read_csv('Filename')`.
    ```ptyhon
    df = pd.read_csv('grade.csv')
    ```
- You may need to adjust your current directory or put your file path in the file name.
## 7. Some important methods
- `df.info()` - give us the overall information of the dataFrame.
- `df.describe()` - give us the summary for the numerical columns
- Transform column to NumPy array (using `fastfood_NJ.csv`).
    ```python
    rating = df['rating'].to_numpy()
    ```
